- render tiles to screen from spritesheet texture
  - vertex shader needs camera translation and world translation uniforms
  - by the end, should be able to do equivalent of SDL_RenderCopy
- render shadows to texture
  - figure out how to render to texture <https://github.com/WebGLSamples/WebGL2Samples/blob/master/samples/fbo_rtt_texture_array.html>
- split out render function and set up animation
- static camera on grid
- handle keyboard input
- add fullscreen mode
- controller support
